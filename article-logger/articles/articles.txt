petros papadakis former usc college football captain and current analyst for fox sports tells truthdig editor chief robert scheer about the lure the game for young people the two also debate whether politics belong the field and the locker room papadakis suggests that unionizing college players could complicated and agrees that college players deserve some financial compensation adapted from truthdig com read the transcript below robert scheer this robert scheer with another edition scheer intelligence where the intelligence comes from guests and guest today petros papadakis person that petros papadakis bob scheer that love having come speak class the university southern california which where recording from papadakis beautiful scheer because you about the only person can get talk honestly about what football does and does not for college campus and for those who don know your work you obviously addition having been the usc football team running back scoring think touchdowns one season papadakis two seasons scheer two seasons papadakis that accurate scheer what you describe the worst football team usc history papadakis captain the worst the year scheer let begin with usc which has been football legend major contender you come from football family your father john played for papadakis older brother taso was starting linebacker here and played here scheer then your brother deserted and went over and played for ucla like begin with one the great achievements football social reformer now there lot feeling what does football your father wrote book with great running back sam cunningham about the integration college football papadakis and great writer don yaeger scheer why don you tell about that book and the significance that papadakis well the head coach usc who was hard man and the head coach alabama who was almost equally hard and two the great legendary coaches the history college football john mckay and bear bryant had relationship they had known each other for long time and the scc believe not was all white league they weren competing obviously they weren competing against other colleges and bear bryant knew that order move alabama forward they were going need integrate the football team order that they were going need show the people alabama that black players were necessary not only necessary but great order that they scheduled usc come play legion field birmingham and father was that team was mike linebacker think was defensive captain had tackles the game sam cunningham obviously playing his first game ever sophomore freshmen didn play back then had great game multiple touchdowns over yards that was the game that kind they say turned the tide the south usc was big part that social reform remember years before that roberts another great trojan big big black running back went texas and did something similar usc being the west coast think too and the cunningham family was from santa barbara they didn know southern racism lot the guys who play don scheer people don know was black player and legend papadakis his brother randall cunningham lot people know and randall son olympic level high jumper here now usc and was your class couple years ago gave him ride home after spoke your class that tradition continues usc but very interesting because due criticism believe the university the last time usc took trip play team alabama they brought father the trip and spoke the team this year because guess some divisiveness the program and some the way that reacted media position over the years usc decision making they invited sam but not father who wrote the book together that kind bummed out thought that they were kind above that when came some their great history scheer you and your father probably don even agree your view the whole thing papadakis don agree but you know what talk lot about usc and how shape opinion scheer for people who don know the family you did cooperate running one the great greek restaurants papadakis yeah and that where usc did most their recruiting the peak carroll era you can imagine mean not just the guys that ended signing here like the reggie bushes and lendale white but the tim tebows the world and speller all the great college football players came through there the recruitment scheer before get winded too far for this story mean you say amazingly enough much the south was still segregated athletics and university you know not ancient history that jackie robinson came after world war when fought the great war for freedom that the army itself was segregated and what have you and basketball when the lakers came here from minnesota there was something like only two blacks could team was the sort code and what have you papadakis usc always been the forefront that you could say that scheer one the good things and you pointed out when you spoke class that once you playing together there intimacy even you discriminate certain positions like the quarterback the coach what have you which legendary the fact athletics has broken down racial barriers papadakis has but the same time something this not something talked about whole bunch your class because wasn socially relevant especially young kids but with the anniversary and the simpson stuff and obviously simpson played here usc and there deep history there and played with father remember and totally forgot about but remember simpson just the subject not because was usc locker room because was never really around but just you brought most the white guys the team thought that was killer and most the black guys the team really thought was innocent framed whatever her son did there was some theory you couldn bring that remember you couldn bring that unless you wanted get into heated discussion and sometimes was funny sometimes people got their feelings hurt but that was real thing today makes wonder with all the different things going racially our country and the narrative that have what the conversations the locker room are like when comes the anthem and different things like that football once you out the tunnel and you locking arms mean you and those guys against the world think about the world boxing those guys really have much respect for athletics because they just naked the world and you going fight that ring and there nobody help you except for the bell scheer didn give you proper introduction let just say your football career you didn into the pros because you were severely injured and had real problems and you actually were one the lucky athletes who didn into the pros you found way make living and you been major radio personality and you done national television broadcasting and forth and that what you this day you one the guys who managed get good career out this papadakis one the uglier broadcasters the air and sweatier scheer yeah but off the field think this day you have objective view what goes with sports yet when had you the class and talk you you played down certain things you played down concussions was one papadakis yeah little bit scheer the other hand when you get going you talk about what did your head right papadakis yeah well and that something all have monitor those that played football from the past and guys playing now there doubt something people need think about just like any been talking out behind about sports for years now platforms where people hear and your opinions evolve and things change the concussion thing opinion kind started change when started get own head checked out and wondering why had these flashes emotion and these different things that not unique the football world deal with that being said when comes concussions and football every guy playing high level and this has always been argument they know what happening out there like remember casablanca where the captain renaud says shocked shocked that there gambling going hitting each other the head with our heads there not lot grey area there know what doing nobody putting gun anybody head that why always used say when the guys would pray before the games and they all lock arms and pray for victory and pray for all these things and would say the guys even though greek orthodox christian say gods not making this this our choice this our identity this who are your identity football player that really your identity then concussions probably aren your mindset now you played five years the nfl and had your bell rung few times and you made some money and you have wife and kids you thinking about retiring couple guys have not every guy but few guys and more often than ever before have started walk away from the sport younger ages scheer began discussing sports educator which was around segregation certainly integration sports terms the money you got these coaches the college level what does the coach avalon make million papadakis reported but you know somebody might say hey good job coach here million mean one the alums they working level and you understand politics way that could never even begin scratch and always figured when you the president you been bought and sold times somebody you working level that far beyond lot people contemplation when you the head coach usc alabama very similar there things that are touching you and things that you part that the rest just don know how much money actually being made have mean when pete carroll was here had idea how much money was making there was listed salary but with private school and not having report anything but his own tax attorneys who knows who knows how much money coming into that guy most states they public institutions the highest paid person the state generally like iowa these places the head coach the basketball football team men basketball scheer have this issue even the amateur level the ncaa and forth papadakis treat these guys like the leaders society makes crosstalk scheer they make enormous amounts money and then they send people like you out the field and you you used the word not fashionable anymore but you always refer yourself cripple papadakis yeah legally scheer legally through your injuries and they kind typical aren they aside from the concussion papadakis one injury foot was relatively unique fact was one the worst here you can still see the rays screensaver one the trainers down there because they had never seen anything like foot just looked like exploded and all the bones basically scattered almost like bag cereal pins and needles and screws and two staph infections and long time the hospital scheer even not unique and teach here also and had students and they blow out their knee papadakis everybody gets hurt you always going get surgery scheer they get hurt and then suddenly there isn the professional career they vulnerable sticking the money for minute here such grotesque contradiction that you telling these kids one two things either good trojan great for the school great for the spirit and you going get banged and the odds are even top ranked school like this most you are not going make living this papadakis scheer then forget about all the other sports that you got going the other hand when people come along like they did northwestern and say they want form union they want compensation know the past you been contemptuous that dismissive papadakis well the union thing particular now you understand that stuff better than and know there was reason they did illinois and all that the same time you can sign the letter intent which has very clear language with saying you going play somebody for somebody scholarship and then turn around and try unionize just doesn work that way that being said understand think are evolving think should better place was always the because was guy who went school here and was big mess anybody school here had many problems any college student probably more and the same time was carrying the ball whole lot practice and taking shots and taking pills and doing whatever had get out there and got degree here got two degrees not only that the university community and being part and major which was odd for football player but english and american lit helped considerably work and communicating with people did that while falling apart the football team and there way more diligent guys than out there and they really make the most their situation scheer you did get education here because you were kind weirdo and you became english major and you read dostoyevsky and everything and all that papadakis yeah did scheer now what about kids coming school and say hey got black lives matter movement america going read about going look into see the national anthem and the third stanza the national anthem actually says good thing have freed slaves and that the brits are terrible people for taking them into their army there are contradictions what wrong whether the college level the pro level somebody saying okay play the game but full human being got free speech rights got right have attitude got right speak and you know what use celebrity the same way other people use their celebrity support things that care about papadakis vacuum don think there anything wrong with vacuum pretending wouldn effect anybody else the team however you your own one person your own individual whatever you want obviously there incongruities throughout history that you can point matter what you want against christianity here america anything that people tend really cling the only problem with football team they constantly tell you what you represent which not yourself the team when you wearing that uniform when you have that platform not because you full thinking human being all because you football player that why you have the platform just own situation somebody was causing football player usc have answer questions about political proclivities because what they were doing that problem football team maybe not for everybody but divider scheer let ask you the basic question about the money and thought okay you got people who presumably have gone through college have thought about things they think about social justice they think about life they think about they look the money coming into this sport they look and that the one thing they not supposed ask tough questions about terms its social impact right college you not supposed question that your coach who yelling you all the time making this incredible amount money you kid who comes from maybe where your family didn have enough get and this guy making million how much does the bandleader make papadakis art bartner scheer yeah papadakis don know his endowment but sure does quite well scheer mean the assistant coaches quite often papadakis some them make millions scheer yeah the guys who the weight training and all that papadakis least hundreds thousands scheer aren exposing people situation where just human beings you think they want say wait minute having trouble paying rent having trouble you have pointed out when you come class getting pizza where your picture was the box one your stories and yet not supposed question where the money going papadakis think you should able question where the money going there problem about that also think live free society and somebody wants pay you for something that what you worth these guys they want play football football attractive them because the money flowing through football there are countless just because guys don the league doesn mean that they don have life football there was guy played with here kenichi daisy who was number pick the draft and came down with leukemia and beat but couldn play football anymore coach chris richard guy played with the coordinator for seattle scheer got you but crosstalk papadakis they get into the profession scheer you have this organization called the ncaa and they the ones that have stressed the amateur amateur amateur amateur right they only stress for the players papadakis they all tied the whole thing based hypocrisy you want defend that you barking the wrong tree the best solution and something very doable guy gets his units every semester you give him the bank has five years graduates walks there for young person start their life out with opposed just being spit out program when they can longer use you whether you crippled you can play the league whether you moving the nfl doesn matter whoever you are lonely feeling when you done playing here because they can use you anymore and there somebody new coming there always going more football players not less far history goes you going forgotten scheer think class you said you wouldn let your child play football papadakis don want but meat head violent kid think might just such meat head that have have him play scheer the family let shift this little bit get the pros they are making much money whether they lousy good because the contracts the shared revenue and everything papadakis for short amount time there lot money scheer the other hand and usc broadcasting now usc happens control the colosseum here and play the colosseum and the rams are playing the colosseum until their new stadium built okay they abandoned right city that liked them papadakis louis scheer yes papadakis lovely place scheer okay but they abandoned they used here they went papadakis they were cleveland before that scheer then they come here fortunately understand unless missing something least they using their own money build crosstalk papadakis yeah kroenke going build himself which why getting done scheer then there question who are they going steal from some other place going san diego horror horrors they steal the oakland raiders papadakis they vegas scheer which happened once before oakland goes vegas papadakis you care raider fan just universal thing scheer oakland raiders leave oakland not raider fan papadakis even vegas scheer didn with them once been raider fan since the season ticket holder tell the truth fanatical anyone and the reason papadakis you face painter aren you bob scheer yeah wear the costume does get the money thing now these teams make much money the idea that they can remain loyal community outrageous doesn bother you all papadakis they don care money maker they don care scheer talking greed now right papadakis yeah but that american business they only care far looks good bad look the let forget about the individual owners and what they own let just look the nfl whole the nfl made what billionaire owners that have little boys club and that that that one gets out the door the most elite club the world maybe the english premiere league similar london but these are people that are beyond our comprehension when comes how they move and change things around the the nfl stands for lawyers because all they really want and all they really concerned with whether not players beating people whether not players beating themselves whether not suicide whether not concussions whatever the issue they only concerned with protecting their own ass that the only thing they care about protect the money that being made their owners these are multi billionaire people and maybe they care about their players maybe they don but they chip them off the money that they have order stay business they hire and fire coaches order stay business people this and that they keep player who violent long they can until somehow public problem and people get after them and then just like any other corporation trying hold them higher standard because people root and care about their product think futile because they don care just business look joe montana suing the nfl the greatest quarterback the history the nfl and they don speak each other they have giant lawsuits going back and forth this not patty cake league big ugly american endeavor and all those things you like you fan don not huge pro football really not more college football person the pro football just too much too good the margin error too small and just not fun everybody runs the same offense everybody runs the same defense everybody plays the same songs the stadium just feels generic cookie cutter league all the games fit into three hour windows just prefer the college game because that what know and that what more passionate about there doubt that the nfl become something that even very different from what grew with which was giant even then remember those raider teams and marcus allen and todd marinovich and jay schroeder and all those teams here growing changed people are very very passionate about football and they don understand the sport that what think little dangerous about scheer what they missing papadakis just don think they relate the flesh and blood under the uniform think they think all robo cops out there mean really think people look football players and you know what certain degree how can you blame them especially with the way lot these guys behave off the field that also not make excuses for people because all responsible for what matter what but that certain there product that the sport the sport breeds violence trains people respond with violence you not violent enough you not good enough and for act shocked when that boils over college campus environment entertainment environment some big city where the pro players are should never shock people scheer what the role the media describing all this want conclude this you media person now you gone from being player media and was kind strange read articles after usc got wiped out alabama opening game the times was mercilessly television radio all you guys were just bashing them what wonder what the conflict interest that the media has covering sports papadakis there major conflict interest because you have broadcast partnerships the broadcast partnerships are what worth much money and that why don have pay play that why you don itunes and pay cents watch the raider game because that would eliminate the network the middle man and the money being made the networks and the league making deal with each other that where the money coming your role when you actually putting the game television the analyst which job the play play guy the sideline person the production the truck and the people back the studio that producing toward and the seven cameras that have out there our responsibility celebrate this game the way look these guys are not being compensated want give them good call want give these guys what they deserve going give them their moment publicly want say their name properly want their family able watch the game crosstalk scheer that fair enough but what about reporting papadakis let say after the game scheer come penn state right now doing the anniversary papadakis just telling you the differences that there differences you know when calling the game not going talk about what happened with jerry sandusky radio show passionate about and need take stand about something can that the studio fox you probably somewhere the middle there when you the game feel like you have responsibility the players and the coaches put that thing whatever your column whatever your place commentary like for radio show then ahead you passionate about then ahead and say that kind where kind drawn the line every medium has its own boundary whether the printed word whether studio whether game whether internet kind thing the radio these are all different things where you can take different angles and take different stances the truth the harder you the more you going hear from your quote unquote broadcast partners whoever employing you depends who your boss just like you were writing newspaper scheer the crowded media field supposed give some hope you got bloggers who can call you out you got websites and forth papadakis think just becomes place where you the place where they saying what you want hear scheer that one danger and the other least the old established you been around you still young guy you not even yet papadakis almost scheer you been around lot and you seen how changed seems least the old days cbs the times the new york times these were major institutions that could tell even professional team college program youve got shape you not doing right you not handling now they all seem bed with the people they supposed covering they running scared they don know whether they even going business papadakis they all started resemble each other kind like the end animal farm man and pigs and all that way that they started just really fill the stereotype that you always thought everybody always talked about okay there three places work big network sports there three places you can work only worked one you don want work all three before you because then you not going work anymore you going burn your bridges work fox the reputation fox fox great they let you yourself the infrastructure little wacky but they let you yourself get used things changing and every year lot chaos cbs everybody stuffed shirt right were the les moonves building you wear the eye your jacket and you don say boo anything like that everything about jim nance and the masters that cbs espn abc all about mickey mouse and disney you piss off the mouse you gone really those places mean people told that when was young and said everybody different and every crew different and every producer different kind worked more towards just really confused think and discombobulated media kind like flight schedule those places have really kind emerged exactly what you expect them don think that good for the media don think you should able somewhere and just see what you expect see you know what mean just see what you want hear you cbs and they are going say great things about the fcc you fox and they going say great things about the pac and big because those are their broadcast partners you the espn and they back the fcc just promoting our broadcast partners and not doing any kind real analysis work like see get back that little bit more scheer have get back this sometime the future papadakis come back scheer you got last word about public radio throw papadakis npr kcrw listen been this station santa monica city college and always loved this station you ever been downstairs and know they redoing even going more spectacular but just the corridor the black and white photos every great person from gorvey dahl iggy pop the hallway the place and you say wow coming here the air

petros papadakis former usc college football captain and current analyst for fox sports tells truthdig editor chief robert scheer about the lure the game for young people the two also debate whether politics belong the field and the locker room papadakis suggests that unionizing college players could complicated and agrees that college players deserve some financial compensation adapted from truthdig com read the transcript below robert scheer this robert scheer with another edition scheer intelligence where the intelligence comes from guests and guest today petros papadakis person that petros papadakis bob scheer that love having come speak class the university southern california which where recording from papadakis beautiful scheer because you about the only person can get talk honestly about what football does and does not for college campus and for those who don know your work you obviously addition having been the usc football team running back scoring think touchdowns one season papadakis two seasons scheer two seasons papadakis that accurate scheer what you describe the worst football team usc history papadakis captain the worst the year scheer let begin with usc which has been football legend major contender you come from football family your father john played for papadakis older brother taso was starting linebacker here and played here scheer then your brother deserted and went over and played for ucla like begin with one the great achievements football social reformer now there lot feeling what does football your father wrote book with great running back sam cunningham about the integration college football papadakis and great writer don yaeger scheer why don you tell about that book and the significance that papadakis well the head coach usc who was hard man and the head coach alabama who was almost equally hard and two the great legendary coaches the history college football john mckay and bear bryant had relationship they had known each other for long time and the scc believe not was all white league they weren competing obviously they weren competing against other colleges and bear bryant knew that order move alabama forward they were going need integrate the football team order that they were going need show the people alabama that black players were necessary not only necessary but great order that they scheduled usc come play legion field birmingham and father was that team was mike linebacker think was defensive captain had tackles the game sam cunningham obviously playing his first game ever sophomore freshmen didn play back then had great game multiple touchdowns over yards that was the game that kind they say turned the tide the south usc was big part that social reform remember years before that roberts another great trojan big big black running back went texas and did something similar usc being the west coast think too and the cunningham family was from santa barbara they didn know southern racism lot the guys who play don scheer people don know was black player and legend papadakis his brother randall cunningham lot people know and randall son olympic level high jumper here now usc and was your class couple years ago gave him ride home after spoke your class that tradition continues usc but very interesting because due criticism believe the university the last time usc took trip play team alabama they brought father the trip and spoke the team this year because guess some divisiveness the program and some the way that reacted media position over the years usc decision making they invited sam but not father who wrote the book together that kind bummed out thought that they were kind above that when came some their great history scheer you and your father probably don even agree your view the whole thing papadakis don agree but you know what talk lot about usc and how shape opinion scheer for people who don know the family you did cooperate running one the great greek restaurants papadakis yeah and that where usc did most their recruiting the peak carroll era you can imagine mean not just the guys that ended signing here like the reggie bushes and lendale white but the tim tebows the world and speller all the great college football players came through there the recruitment scheer before get winded too far for this story mean you say amazingly enough much the south was still segregated athletics and university you know not ancient history that jackie robinson came after world war when fought the great war for freedom that the army itself was segregated and what have you and basketball when the lakers came here from minnesota there was something like only two blacks could team was the sort code and what have you papadakis usc always been the forefront that you could say that scheer one the good things and you pointed out when you spoke class that once you playing together there intimacy even you discriminate certain positions like the quarterback the coach what have you which legendary the fact athletics has broken down racial barriers papadakis has but the same time something this not something talked about whole bunch your class because wasn socially relevant especially young kids but with the anniversary and the simpson stuff and obviously simpson played here usc and there deep history there and played with father remember and totally forgot about but remember simpson just the subject not because was usc locker room because was never really around but just you brought most the white guys the team thought that was killer and most the black guys the team really thought was innocent framed whatever her son did there was some theory you couldn bring that remember you couldn bring that unless you wanted get into heated discussion and sometimes was funny sometimes people got their feelings hurt but that was real thing today makes wonder with all the different things going racially our country and the narrative that have what the conversations the locker room are like when comes the anthem and different things like that football once you out the tunnel and you locking arms mean you and those guys against the world think about the world boxing those guys really have much respect for athletics because they just naked the world and you going fight that ring and there nobody help you except for the bell scheer didn give you proper introduction let just say your football career you didn into the pros because you were severely injured and had real problems and you actually were one the lucky athletes who didn into the pros you found way make living and you been major radio personality and you done national television broadcasting and forth and that what you this day you one the guys who managed get good career out this papadakis one the uglier broadcasters the air and sweatier scheer yeah but off the field think this day you have objective view what goes with sports yet when had you the class and talk you you played down certain things you played down concussions was one papadakis yeah little bit scheer the other hand when you get going you talk about what did your head right papadakis yeah well and that something all have monitor those that played football from the past and guys playing now there doubt something people need think about just like any been talking out behind about sports for years now platforms where people hear and your opinions evolve and things change the concussion thing opinion kind started change when started get own head checked out and wondering why had these flashes emotion and these different things that not unique the football world deal with that being said when comes concussions and football every guy playing high level and this has always been argument they know what happening out there like remember casablanca where the captain renaud says shocked shocked that there gambling going hitting each other the head with our heads there not lot grey area there know what doing nobody putting gun anybody head that why always used say when the guys would pray before the games and they all lock arms and pray for victory and pray for all these things and would say the guys even though greek orthodox christian say gods not making this this our choice this our identity this who are your identity football player that really your identity then concussions probably aren your mindset now you played five years the nfl and had your bell rung few times and you made some money and you have wife and kids you thinking about retiring couple guys have not every guy but few guys and more often than ever before have started walk away from the sport younger ages scheer began discussing sports educator which was around segregation certainly integration sports terms the money you got these coaches the college level what does the coach avalon make million papadakis reported but you know somebody might say hey good job coach here million mean one the alums they working level and you understand politics way that could never even begin scratch and always figured when you the president you been bought and sold times somebody you working level that far beyond lot people contemplation when you the head coach usc alabama very similar there things that are touching you and things that you part that the rest just don know how much money actually being made have mean when pete carroll was here had idea how much money was making there was listed salary but with private school and not having report anything but his own tax attorneys who knows who knows how much money coming into that guy most states they public institutions the highest paid person the state generally like iowa these places the head coach the basketball football team men basketball scheer have this issue even the amateur level the ncaa and forth papadakis treat these guys like the leaders society makes crosstalk scheer they make enormous amounts money and then they send people like you out the field and you you used the word not fashionable anymore but you always refer yourself cripple papadakis yeah legally scheer legally through your injuries and they kind typical aren they aside from the concussion papadakis one injury foot was relatively unique fact was one the worst here you can still see the rays screensaver one the trainers down there because they had never seen anything like foot just looked like exploded and all the bones basically scattered almost like bag cereal pins and needles and screws and two staph infections and long time the hospital scheer even not unique and teach here also and had students and they blow out their knee papadakis everybody gets hurt you always going get surgery scheer they get hurt and then suddenly there isn the professional career they vulnerable sticking the money for minute here such grotesque contradiction that you telling these kids one two things either good trojan great for the school great for the spirit and you going get banged and the odds are even top ranked school like this most you are not going make living this papadakis scheer then forget about all the other sports that you got going the other hand when people come along like they did northwestern and say they want form union they want compensation know the past you been contemptuous that dismissive papadakis well the union thing particular now you understand that stuff better than and know there was reason they did illinois and all that the same time you can sign the letter intent which has very clear language with saying you going play somebody for somebody scholarship and then turn around and try unionize just doesn work that way that being said understand think are evolving think should better place was always the because was guy who went school here and was big mess anybody school here had many problems any college student probably more and the same time was carrying the ball whole lot practice and taking shots and taking pills and doing whatever had get out there and got degree here got two degrees not only that the university community and being part and major which was odd for football player but english and american lit helped considerably work and communicating with people did that while falling apart the football team and there way more diligent guys than out there and they really make the most their situation scheer you did get education here because you were kind weirdo and you became english major and you read dostoyevsky and everything and all that papadakis yeah did scheer now what about kids coming school and say hey got black lives matter movement america going read about going look into see the national anthem and the third stanza the national anthem actually says good thing have freed slaves and that the brits are terrible people for taking them into their army there are contradictions what wrong whether the college level the pro level somebody saying okay play the game but full human being got free speech rights got right have attitude got right speak and you know what use celebrity the same way other people use their celebrity support things that care about papadakis vacuum don think there anything wrong with vacuum pretending wouldn effect anybody else the team however you your own one person your own individual whatever you want obviously there incongruities throughout history that you can point matter what you want against christianity here america anything that people tend really cling the only problem with football team they constantly tell you what you represent which not yourself the team when you wearing that uniform when you have that platform not because you full thinking human being all because you football player that why you have the platform just own situation somebody was causing football player usc have answer questions about political proclivities because what they were doing that problem football team maybe not for everybody but divider scheer let ask you the basic question about the money and thought okay you got people who presumably have gone through college have thought about things they think about social justice they think about life they think about they look the money coming into this sport they look and that the one thing they not supposed ask tough questions about terms its social impact right college you not supposed question that your coach who yelling you all the time making this incredible amount money you kid who comes from maybe where your family didn have enough get and this guy making million how much does the bandleader make papadakis art bartner scheer yeah papadakis don know his endowment but sure does quite well scheer mean the assistant coaches quite often papadakis some them make millions scheer yeah the guys who the weight training and all that papadakis least hundreds thousands scheer aren exposing people situation where just human beings you think they want say wait minute having trouble paying rent having trouble you have pointed out when you come class getting pizza where your picture was the box one your stories and yet not supposed question where the money going papadakis think you should able question where the money going there problem about that also think live free society and somebody wants pay you for something that what you worth these guys they want play football football attractive them because the money flowing through football there are countless just because guys don the league doesn mean that they don have life football there was guy played with here kenichi daisy who was number pick the draft and came down with leukemia and beat but couldn play football anymore coach chris richard guy played with the coordinator for seattle scheer got you but crosstalk papadakis they get into the profession scheer you have this organization called the ncaa and they the ones that have stressed the amateur amateur amateur amateur right they only stress for the players papadakis they all tied the whole thing based hypocrisy you want defend that you barking the wrong tree the best solution and something very doable guy gets his units every semester you give him the bank has five years graduates walks there for young person start their life out with opposed just being spit out program when they can longer use you whether you crippled you can play the league whether you moving the nfl doesn matter whoever you are lonely feeling when you done playing here because they can use you anymore and there somebody new coming there always going more football players not less far history goes you going forgotten scheer think class you said you wouldn let your child play football papadakis don want but meat head violent kid think might just such meat head that have have him play scheer the family let shift this little bit get the pros they are making much money whether they lousy good because the contracts the shared revenue and everything papadakis for short amount time there lot money scheer the other hand and usc broadcasting now usc happens control the colosseum here and play the colosseum and the rams are playing the colosseum until their new stadium built okay they abandoned right city that liked them papadakis louis scheer yes papadakis lovely place scheer okay but they abandoned they used here they went papadakis they were cleveland before that scheer then they come here fortunately understand unless missing something least they using their own money build crosstalk papadakis yeah kroenke going build himself which why getting done scheer then there question who are they going steal from some other place going san diego horror horrors they steal the oakland raiders papadakis they vegas scheer which happened once before oakland goes vegas papadakis you care raider fan just universal thing scheer oakland raiders leave oakland not raider fan papadakis even vegas scheer didn with them once been raider fan since the season ticket holder tell the truth fanatical anyone and the reason papadakis you face painter aren you bob scheer yeah wear the costume does get the money thing now these teams make much money the idea that they can remain loyal community outrageous doesn bother you all papadakis they don care money maker they don care scheer talking greed now right papadakis yeah but that american business they only care far looks good bad look the let forget about the individual owners and what they own let just look the nfl whole the nfl made what billionaire owners that have little boys club and that that that one gets out the door the most elite club the world maybe the english premiere league similar london but these are people that are beyond our comprehension when comes how they move and change things around the the nfl stands for lawyers because all they really want and all they really concerned with whether not players beating people whether not players beating themselves whether not suicide whether not concussions whatever the issue they only concerned with protecting their own ass that the only thing they care about protect the money that being made their owners these are multi billionaire people and maybe they care about their players maybe they don but they chip them off the money that they have order stay business they hire and fire coaches order stay business people this and that they keep player who violent long they can until somehow public problem and people get after them and then just like any other corporation trying hold them higher standard because people root and care about their product think futile because they don care just business look joe montana suing the nfl the greatest quarterback the history the nfl and they don speak each other they have giant lawsuits going back and forth this not patty cake league big ugly american endeavor and all those things you like you fan don not huge pro football really not more college football person the pro football just too much too good the margin error too small and just not fun everybody runs the same offense everybody runs the same defense everybody plays the same songs the stadium just feels generic cookie cutter league all the games fit into three hour windows just prefer the college game because that what know and that what more passionate about there doubt that the nfl become something that even very different from what grew with which was giant even then remember those raider teams and marcus allen and todd marinovich and jay schroeder and all those teams here growing changed people are very very passionate about football and they don understand the sport that what think little dangerous about scheer what they missing papadakis just don think they relate the flesh and blood under the uniform think they think all robo cops out there mean really think people look football players and you know what certain degree how can you blame them especially with the way lot these guys behave off the field that also not make excuses for people because all responsible for what matter what but that certain there product that the sport the sport breeds violence trains people respond with violence you not violent enough you not good enough and for act shocked when that boils over college campus environment entertainment environment some big city where the pro players are should never shock people scheer what the role the media describing all this want conclude this you media person now you gone from being player media and was kind strange read articles after usc got wiped out alabama opening game the times was mercilessly television radio all you guys were just bashing them what wonder what the conflict interest that the media has covering sports papadakis there major conflict interest because you have broadcast partnerships the broadcast partnerships are what worth much money and that why don have pay play that why you don itunes and pay cents watch the raider game because that would eliminate the network the middle man and the money being made the networks and the league making deal with each other that where the money coming your role when you actually putting the game television the analyst which job the play play guy the sideline person the production the truck and the people back the studio that producing toward and the seven cameras that have out there our responsibility celebrate this game the way look these guys are not being compensated want give them good call want give these guys what they deserve going give them their moment publicly want say their name properly want their family able watch the game crosstalk scheer that fair enough but what about reporting papadakis let say after the game scheer come penn state right now doing the anniversary papadakis just telling you the differences that there differences you know when calling the game not going talk about what happened with jerry sandusky radio show passionate about and need take stand about something can that the studio fox you probably somewhere the middle there when you the game feel like you have responsibility the players and the coaches put that thing whatever your column whatever your place commentary like for radio show then ahead you passionate about then ahead and say that kind where kind drawn the line every medium has its own boundary whether the printed word whether studio whether game whether internet kind thing the radio these are all different things where you can take different angles and take different stances the truth the harder you the more you going hear from your quote unquote broadcast partners whoever employing you depends who your boss just like you were writing newspaper scheer the crowded media field supposed give some hope you got bloggers who can call you out you got websites and forth papadakis think just becomes place where you the place where they saying what you want hear scheer that one danger and the other least the old established you been around you still young guy you not even yet papadakis almost scheer you been around lot and you seen how changed seems least the old days cbs the times the new york times these were major institutions that could tell even professional team college program youve got shape you not doing right you not handling now they all seem bed with the people they supposed covering they running scared they don know whether they even going business papadakis they all started resemble each other kind like the end animal farm man and pigs and all that way that they started just really fill the stereotype that you always thought everybody always talked about okay there three places work big network sports there three places you can work only worked one you don want work all three before you because then you not going work anymore you going burn your bridges work fox the reputation fox fox great they let you yourself the infrastructure little wacky but they let you yourself get used things changing and every year lot chaos cbs everybody stuffed shirt right were the les moonves building you wear the eye your jacket and you don say boo anything like that everything about jim nance and the masters that cbs espn abc all about mickey mouse and disney you piss off the mouse you gone really those places mean people told that when was young and said everybody different and every crew different and every producer different kind worked more towards just really confused think and discombobulated media kind like flight schedule those places have really kind emerged exactly what you expect them don think that good for the media don think you should able somewhere and just see what you expect see you know what mean just see what you want hear you cbs and they are going say great things about the fcc you fox and they going say great things about the pac and big because those are their broadcast partners you the espn and they back the fcc just promoting our broadcast partners and not doing any kind real analysis work like see get back that little bit more scheer have get back this sometime the future papadakis come back scheer you got last word about public radio throw papadakis npr kcrw listen been this station santa monica city college and always loved this station you ever been downstairs and know they redoing even going more spectacular but just the corridor the black and white photos every great person from gorvey dahl iggy pop the hallway the place and you say wow coming here the air
